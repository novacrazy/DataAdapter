DataAdapter
===========

Created to use in a school assignment, this C++98 compliant library creates a common interface for data structures, allowing for easy replacement of one with another within a program.

####Testing

For the tests, I used the Google Test framework (version 1.7), so that is required to compile the tests. At some point I'll add a cmakelists.txt to make it easier to do that.
